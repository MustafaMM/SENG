-- AGILE Scrum methodology used.

Very helpful to have XAMPP installed in your device. (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or MAMP(https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/).

To use XAMPP:
Once you have XAMPP, open XAMPP control panel, start the Apache and MySQL servers.

Go to C:\xampp\htdocs, create a folder, unzip and paste the source code in this folder.

Open a web browser and type in localhost/path/to/folder(eg: localhost/folder/), you should be able to view the website now.

To use MAMP:
Open MAMP, go to preferences and do the following: 
1) Go to port, and set the Apache port to 8888.
2) Go to Web Server, select Apache.
3) Make sure that when you are in Web Server, the Document Root is the same root as the folder containing the source code.

Open a web browser and type in localhost:8888, you should be able to view the website now.
