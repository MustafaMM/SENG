-- AGILE Scrum methodology used.

Very helpful to have **XAMPP** (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) or **MAMP**(https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/) installed in your device. 

Make sure the get the source code from the latest branch(working_01).

To use _XAMPP_:

Once you have XAMPP, open XAMPP control panel, start the Apache and MySQL servers.

Go to C:\xampp\htdocs, create a folder, unzip and paste the source code in this folder.

Open a web browser and type in localhost/path/to/folder(eg: localhost/folder/), you should be able to view the website now.

To use _MAMP_:

Create a folder containing the source code.
Open MAMP, go to preferences and do the following: 
1) Go to port, and set the Apache port to 8888.
2) Go to Web Server, select Apache.
3) Make sure that when you are in Web Server, the Document Root is the same root as the folder containing the source code.
4) Start the servers from the main page

Open a web browser and type in localhost:8888, you should be able to view the website now.
