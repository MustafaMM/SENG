To open a php file in chrome, I 
downloaded MAMP and then go to prefrences and do the following: 
1) Go to port, and in there set Apache to 8888.
2) Also, make sure in Web Server you select Apache.
3) Make sure that when you are in Web Server, the 
  Document Root is the same root as the folder 
  containing your php file.


After that, you can just open a chrome tab, type
"localhost:8888" (without quotations) and you
should see the upload stuff... :)
